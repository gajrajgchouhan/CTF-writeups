Remember the morse code used in Parasite ?

Let's first decrypt the morse code from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)
and since this is the korean morse code [SKATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKATS)
we should take two spaces to seperate syllables and one space for separating words.

Now I used a korean keyboard I had found online to write the Hangul characters.

This is what I got -
```희 망 은 진 정 한 기 생 충 입 니 ㅕㅏ```
Now just put it in google translate to get
```Hope is a true parasite```
make it lowercase and add underscores-```hope_is_a_true_parasite```
You get the flag :D

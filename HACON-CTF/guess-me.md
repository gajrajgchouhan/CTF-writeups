### Guess Me

The given encrypted text could not have been any base encoding or a rot cipher due to it's gibberish language. So I thought it might have been XOR cipher.

I used 'XOR Brute Force' on CyberChef. I added known string as 'HACSEC', as increased keylength to 2. Some English letters would start to appear like `HACSECAN!CE_GU3SS}`.

Since this was a guessing chall, I guessed and replaced `A` with `{`.
